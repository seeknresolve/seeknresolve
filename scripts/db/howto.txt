Development and test databases creation:
========================================

Prerequisites:
==============

PostgreSQL in version 9.1 or greater is needed and installed in system.
On Ubuntu it can be installed by typing a command:
    sudo apt-get install postgresql-9.1

Then change in pg_hba.conf is needed.
This file is located in various places based on operating system.
On Ubuntu it can be found in:
    /etc/postgresql/${version}/main

Make sure, that you have there entry:
local   all             all                                     md5

It allows local connection to DB authenticated by password.


Database creation:
==================

You need to log as postgres user in your terminal.
For example using command:
    sudo su postgres

Then you can log to DB using command:
    psql

In postgres console you can eiter paste necessary sql statements from create_*_db.sql files or
run them directly using psql instruction:
    \i fileName

You need to be in directory where file is visible and have enough permissions to be read by other users.
