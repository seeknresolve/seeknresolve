Seek'N'Resolve
==============

Seek'N'Resolve is bug tracking tool. It supports grouping bugs in projects, role for users and auditioning of bugs and changes made by users.

It has been written in Java 8 with Gradle as build tool and Spring Boot as basic application framework. Database used for application is PostgreSQL 9.3.

It is still very early version, so it lacks more advanced functionality but more features are coming in the near future. Pull requests are welcome.
